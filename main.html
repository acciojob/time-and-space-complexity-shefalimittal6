    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms, allowing developers to choose the most efficient solution for their problems.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed in terms of Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the space required grows linearly with the input size. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential for optimizing resource usage in applications.</p>
