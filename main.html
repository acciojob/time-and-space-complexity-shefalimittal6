    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the time an algorithm takes to run based on the size of the input. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity, allowing them to run faster even for large input sizes.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. An algorithm's space complexity can be as important as its time complexity, especially when dealing with large datasets. A common example of space complexity is O(n), where the memory usage increases linearly with the input size.</p>
