    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity, ensuring that they can handle larger inputs within reasonable time constraints.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run. It is crucial to consider space complexity to ensure that the program doesn't use excessive memory, especially with large datasets. An example of space complexity is O(n), where the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
